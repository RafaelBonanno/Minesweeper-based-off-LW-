We want to create a the classic game [Minesweeper](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=minesweeper+windows) in our browser.

A boilerplate is provided to get you started, containing:

- `index.html`: a 2x2 grid for the game. Make it bigger if you like!
- `minseweeper.css`: contains classes that you can apply to your table cells (`td`) to display the relevant tile image. Here, we are using an svg file as the `background-image`. Then, we set the file size to 24 pixels (you can make it bigger or smaller if you want)
- `lib/minesweeper.js`: this is where you should put your code!
